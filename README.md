# Real_Time_Chat_App
Created a real time  web based chat application using the concepts of Web Sockets along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

A simple web based application that can be used for transfer of messages. 
To run the app, navigate to nodeserver folder and run the command "node index.js" or "nodemon index.js"
Then go live with the index.html page , open multiple instances of it and now communication between all those instances can take place.
